# Ghostbuster: Recomputed Logprobs with New Language Models

This repository provides recomputed token-level log probability files (`logprobs`) for the datasets used in the [Ghostbuster](https://github.com/vivek3141/ghostbuster) project, using alternative language models such as `Llama-2-7b-hf` and `Tiny_Llama_v1.1` . This effort aims to replicate the Ghostbuster methodology while exploring the behavior of newer open-source LLMs.
